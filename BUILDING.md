# Tenacity Build Instructions

## Prerequisites

### Linux

Not all distros package the right versions of Tenacity's dependencies, if at
all. For example, wxWidgets 3.1.5 or later is required for building Tenacity,
but some (mostly older) distributions only package wxWidgets 3.0.
[PortMidi](https://github.com/portmidi/portmidi) and
[PortSMF](https://codeberg.org/tenacityteam/portsmf) are required for MIDI support
but some distributions do not package PortSMF (Tenacity can still build without
MIDI support). [libsbsms](https://github.com/claytonotey/libsbsms) is an
optional dependency used for time stretching that is not available in many Linux
distribution package managers either. Optionally,
[vcpkg can be used](#vcpkg-on-Linux) to build dependencies from source which
may be helpful if your distribution is missing some packages. Note that we use our
own fork of vcpkg for the time being, which is required for some features such as
high-quality stretching (libsbsms), MP2 support (TwoLAME), and recording desktop
audio on Windows. However, you may be able to use the latest vcpkg upstream,
although the features mentioned prior will be unavailable and your build might not
succeed.

Installing ccache and ninja-build is highly recommended for faster builds but
not required. CMake will automatically use ccache if it is installed.

#### Debian, Ubuntu, and derived distributions

On Debian 12 or later, Ubuntu 22.10 or later, or any applicable derivative,
run:

```
sudo apt-get install build-essential libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libavutil-dev libflac++-dev libglib2.0-dev libgtk-3-dev libid3tag0-dev libjack-jackd2-dev liblilv-dev libmad0-dev libmp3lame-dev libogg-dev libpng-dev portaudio19-dev libportmidi-dev libportsmf-dev libserd-dev libsndfile1-dev libsord-dev libsoundtouch-dev libsoxr-dev libsuil-dev libtwolame-dev vamp-plugin-sdk libvorbis-dev lv2-dev zlib1g-dev cmake ninja-build libjpeg-dev libtiff-dev liblzma-dev libsqlite3-dev libzip-dev zipcmp zipmerge ziptool rapidjson-dev wx-common wx3.2-headers libwxgtk3.2-dev
```

On earlier versions of Debian, Ubuntu, and applicable derivatives, exclude
`wx-common`, `wx3.2-headers`, and `libwxgtk3.2-dev`. Those distros do not
include the right version of wxWidgets needed for Tenacity. To get the right
version of wxWidgets, you will need to either use vcpkg or build wxWidgets
yourself. The latter is preferred as using vcpkg will build _all_ of Tenacity's
dependencies from scratch (i.e., virtuall no system dependencies are used at
all, **which takes a really long time to build**). Only use vcpkg if you
absolutely must. Please see [Building wxWidgets](#building-wxwidgets) for more
information.

#### Fedora

To install Tenacity's dependencies, run:

```
sudo dnf install alsa-lib-devel cmake expat-devel flac-devel gcc-g++ gettext-devel rapidjson-devel lame-devel libid3tag-devel libmad-devel libmatroska-devel libogg-devel libsndfile-devel libvorbis-devel libzip-tools lilv-devel lv2-devel portaudio-devel portmidi-devel serd-devel sord-devel soundtouch-devel soxr-devel sqlite-devel sratom-devel suil-devel taglib-devel twolame-devel wavpack-devel vamp-plugin-sdk-devel wxGTK-devel zlib-devel ccache ninja-build git ffmpeg-free-devel wxGTK-devel
```

#### Arch

Install Tenacity's build dependencies with this command:

```
sudo pacman -S cmake ninja ccache expat gcc-libs gdk-pixbuf2 glibc flac gtk3 glib2 libid3tag lilv mpg123 libmatroska libogg portaudio portmidi libsndfile libsoxr suil twolame vamp-plugin-sdk libvorbis opusfile wavpack soundtouch ffmpeg libsbsms wxwidgets-common wxwidgets-gtk3 rapidjson
```

TODO: add portsmf to this package list when the package is updated.

#### Alpine

The build dependencies for Tenacity and, starting in 3.17, wxWidgets can be
found on Alpine's `community` repository. On Alpine Linux 3.17 or later, install
the dependencies with this command:

```
sudo apk add cmake samurai lame-dev libsndfile-dev soxr-dev sqlite-dev portaudio-dev portmidi-dev libid3tag-dev soundtouch-dev libmad-dev ffmpeg-dev wxwidgets rapidjson
```

For older versions of Alpine (i.e., 3.16 and below), please refer to the
[wxWidgets documentation](https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/blob/master/docs/gtk/install.md)
for how to install it from source code, and make sure to set
`--disable-xlocale` in the configuration.

If building wxWidgets from source, run the following command to install
wxWidgets' dependencies:

```
sudo apk add gtk+3.0-dev zlib-dev libpng-dev tiff-dev libjpeg-turbo-dev expat-dev
```

TODO: add portsmf and libsbsms to this package list when aports are accepted.

### FreeBSD

Building is exactly the same on Linux, but since FreeBSD is its own system, it
is technically right to put it under its own section.

Only two packages are missing on FreeBSD: PortSMF and libsbsms. Until PortSMF
gets packaged, Tenacity will not support MIDI import on FreeBSD. High-quality
stretching and pitch-shifting is still supported via non-destructive stretching
and pitch-shifting as that uses a different algorithm that is provided
internally and does not require external dependencies.

To install Tenacity's dependencies, run the following command below:

```
# You may replace 'sudo' with 'doas' if you are using the latter
sudo pkg install wx32-gtk3 cmake ninja ccache pkgconf lame libsndfile libsoxr portaudio lv2 lilv suil vamp-plugin-sdk portmidi libid3tag twolame mpg123 libmatroska soundtouch ffmpeg opusfile wavpack libzip rapidjson
```

#### vcpkg on Linux

Optionally, you can build dependencies from source using vcpkg, although vcpkg
is not set up to build GTK or GLib either for wxWidgets. To use vcpkg for
dependencies, pass `-DVCPKG=ON` to the CMake configure command. You will need
[nasm](https://www.nasm.us/) installed to build ffmpeg from vcpkg which you can
install from your distribution's package manager. If you use vcpkg, you need to
set the `WX_CONFIG` environment variable to the path of the wx-config script
installed by wxWidgets. For example, if you installed wxWidgets to /usr/local:

```
export WX_CONFIG=/usr/local/bin/wx-config
```

If you switch between system packages and vcpkg, you may need to delete
`CMakeCache.txt` inside your CMake build directory.

**NOTE**: Building Tenacity with vcpkg for the first time and after an update
will take a while, especially with FFmpeg. Subsequent rebuilds will be much
faster.

### Windows

Install
[Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/)
with the **Desktop development with C++** installation option. **Be sure to
check the C++ MFC options to ensure the build succeeds too**.

**Note**: Tenacity requires at least Visual Studio 2017 or later. We actively
test against the latest version of Visual Studio, so we may not catch bugs
affecting older versions of Visual Studio, but please report them as we will
still fix them.

We srongly recommend using a package manager for managing build tools as it
makes general management, such as updating or removing them, easier. We like to
use [Scoop](https://scoop.sh) in CI. It contains all of the build tools needed
for Tenacity. If you don't already have Scoop installed, open PowerShell and
run the following commands:

``` powershell
> Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
> Invoke-RestMethod -Uri https://get.scoop.sh | Invoke-Expression]
```

Then, from the same PowerShell window, run the command to install Tenacity's
build tools:

``` powershell
> scoop install git cmake ninja gettext
```

Optionally, you can install sccache for faster builds. We highly recommend you
do so:

``` powershell
> scoop install sccache
```

Alternatively, you can use a different package manager such as Chocolatey or
winget. You may even use a package manager for a different language, such as
Cargo, if that works for you. However, they might not contain all the build
tools you need. For example, Chocolatey does not contain gettext, so you'll
need to install it yourself. winget is also missing a few other build tools
too. Finally, you can install all the build tools yourself, but once you
starting using a package manager, you'll realize there's no going back :)

Tenacity's dependencies will be built automatically with vcpkg when configuring
CMake. You can turn off vcpkg by passing `-DVCPKG=OFF` to the CMake
configuration command, but then it is up to you to install all of Tenacity's
dependencies.

Note that building the dependencies requires 10 GB of storage space.

#### Building with MSYS2 (Experimental)
**NOTE**: These instructions are experimental. Tenacity may not build at all
yet.

If you don't want to use Tenacity with Visual Studio and MSVC, you can
alternatively build Tenacity under MSYS2 using your environment of choice. This
may be preferrable to vcpkg as you don't need to build all of Tenacity's
dependencies first before building Tenacity.

Keep in mind that we only support the following environments:

- UCRT64
- CLANG64
- CLANGARM64

The rule of thumb is this: any environment that links to the UCRT C standard
library is a supported environment. This is regardless of any architecture.

To install the required packages, including any development tools if you
_don't_ have them already, first note your environment's prefix. For example,
under CLANG64, its prefix will be `mingw-w64-clang-x86_64`. Therefore, you
would run the following command to install the packages for the CLANG64
environment:

```bash
$ pacman -S mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-cmake mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-ninja mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-clang \
  mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-libid3tag mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-mpg123 mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-libsndfile \
  mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-portaudio mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-wxwidgets3.2-common mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-wxwidgets3.2-msw \

  mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-libsbsms mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-lv2 mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-lilv \
  mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-suil mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-soundtouch mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-wavpack \
  mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-vamp-plugin-sdk mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-portsmf
```

For CLANGARM64:

```bash
$ pacman -S mingw-w64-clang-aarch64-cmake mingw-w64-clang-aarch64-ninja mingw-w64-clang-aarch64-clang \
  mingw-w64-clang-aarch64-libid3tag mingw-w64-clang-aarch64-mpg123 mingw-w64-clang-aarch64-libsndfile \

  mingw-w64-clang-aarch64-twolame mingw-w64-clang-aarch64-lame mingw-w64-clang-aarch64-flac \
  mingw-w64-clang-aarch64-opusfile mingw-w64-clang-aarch64-libvorbis mingw-w64-clang-aarch64-libebml \
  mingw-w64-clang-aarch64-libmatroska mingw-w64-clang-aarch64-portmidi mingw-w64-clang-aarch64-rapidjson \
  mingw-w64-clang-aarch64-libzip mingw-w64-clang-aarch64-libsoxr mingw-w64-clang-aarch64-sqlite3 \
  mingw-w64-clang-aarch64-libsbsms mingw-w64-clang-aarch64-lv2 mingw-w64-clang-aarch64-lilv \
  mingw-w64-clang-aarch64-suil mingw-w64-clang-aarch64-soundtouch mingw-w64-clang-aarch64-wavpack \
  mingw-w64-clang-aarch64-vamp-plugin-sdk mingw-w64-clang-aarch64-portsmf
```

For UCRT64:

```bash
$ pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-cmake mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-ninja mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gcc \
  mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-libid3tag mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-mpg123 mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-libsndfile \
  mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-portaudio mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-wxwidgets3.2-common mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-wxwidgets3.2-msw \
  mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-twolame mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-lame mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-flac \
  mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-opusfile mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-libvorbis mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-libebml \
  mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-libmatroska mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-portmidi mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-rapidjson \
  mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-libzip mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-libsoxr mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-sqlite3 \
  mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-libsbsms mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-lv2 mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-lilv \
  mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-suil mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-soundtouch mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-wavpack \
  mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-vamp-plugin-sdk mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-portsmf
```

**WARNING**:
- Do NOT install the regular `cmake` package from the `msys` repository! That
  version of CMake uses POSIX emulation, which is **NOT** supported.
- Be very careful about which compiler packages you have installed as they
  could conflict with each other and cause the build to fail. For example,
  using a different `clang` package other than `mingw-w64-clang-x86_64` in the
  CLANG64 environment will cause the build to fail.
- Tenacity may not build successfully under any MSYS2 environment. This is
  currently being worked on and pull requests are accepted.

If you _do_ already have some development tools installed, such as CMake and
Ninja, you can add them to your MSYS2 path. Edit your `~/.bashrc` and add the
following line:

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:/c/path/to/existing/dev/tools/bin
```

### macOS

Install the Clang C++ compiler and macOS SDK from the Xcode command line tools.
If you have the Xcode IDE installed, you already have the command line tools
too. To install the Xcode command line tools without the Xcode IDE, launch the
Terminal application, and type the following command:

```
xcode-select --install
```

Click "Install" on the software update popup window that will appear and wait
for the download and installation to finish.

You will also need to install a few build tools and dependencies, which can be
installed from [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```
brew install cmake ccache ninja nasm wxwidgets
```

The rest of the dependencies will be built automatically with vcpkg when
configuring CMake. You turn off vcpkg by passing `-DVCPKG=OFF` to the CMake
configuration command, but then it is up to you to install all of Tenacity's
dependencies.


### Haiku

To install Tenacity's dependencies on Haiku, run the following command:

```bash
~> pkgman install cmake ninja portaudio_devel wxgtk_source libsndfile_devel soxr_devel \
   rapidjson libzip_devel zlib expat_devel lame_devel sqlite_devel portmidi_devel portsmf_devel \
   libid3tag_devel mpg123_devel twolame_devel libebml_devel libmatroska_devel libogg_devel \
   libvorbis_devel opusfile_devel flac_devel wavpack_devel libsbsms_devel libsoundtouch_devel \
   vamp_plugin_sdk_devel
```

This command should also install Tenacity's runtime dependencies also.

**Note for packagers**: Tenacity is missing the following packages for certain features:
- LV2 Support: suil

Optionally install `ccache` to speed up builds if you plan on recompiling
Tenacity multiple times:

```bash
~> pkgman install ccache
```

### Building wxWidgets

If you are using a Linux distribution that doesn't ship wxWidgets 3.1.3 or
later or you want to use your own version of wxWidgets for testing purposes
(e.g., to test Tenacity against different ports like wxQt), you can optionally
build your own version of wxWidgets.

There are two ways to build wxWidgets:

#### vcpkg

Adding `-DVCPKG=On` to your CMake options will automatically build wxWidgets in
addition to all of Tenacity's other dependencies. This is helpful if several
dependencies are missing from your distro, but it will cause very long build
times if you have not used vcpkg before or updated your vcpkg repo.

#### Building wxWidgets Yourself

If you just need wxWidgets or want to try another version of wxWidgets, such as
a git version, it will be preferrable to build it yourself. Building wxWidgets
is significantly faster than using vcpkg.

To build wxWidgets, please refer to the
[wxWidgets documentation](https://docs.wxwidgets.org/latest/plat_gtk_install.html)
for how to build and install it from source code.

**NOTE**: The wxWidgets for GTK installation instructions don't mention that
you have to have all of the git submodules in place and at the right versions
before starting. Make sure you clone it like this first:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets.git
cd wxWidgets
```

## Building Tenacity

On Windows, if not using MSYS2, run the commands below from the x64 Native Tools
Command Prompt. For other operating systems, run them from a normal shell. For
MSYS2, run them from your environment's appropriate shell.

First, download the Tenacity source code:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://codeberg.org/tenacityteam/tenacity
cd tenacity
```

This will clone Tenacity and all of its submodules, libnyquist and vcpkg. If
you don't want vcpkg, you can remove `--recurse-submodules` and do
`git submodule update --init lib-src/libnyquist` afterwards.

**NOTE**: What will be cloned is the latest development branch by default. If
you want a stable version, run `git checkout [version]` where `[version]` is
the version of Tenacity you want to check out starting with a `v`. For example,
if you want to checkout verison 1.3.4, you would run `git checkout v1.3.4`.

Then, configure CMake. On macOS, Windows, and other platforms using vcpkg
(including on Linux if manually enabled), this will take a long time because
vcpkg will bootstrap itself and then compile Tenacity's dependencies. `-G Ninja`
is recommended for faster builds but not required. Add
`-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/some/path` to change the installation path from the
default /usr/local:

```
cmake -G Ninja -S . -B build
```

**Note**: Under MSYS2, be sure to add `-DVCPKG=OFF` to ensure vcpkg does not
automatically build dependencies. (You should install dependencies from the
repos instead). You may also wisth to add `-DSBSMS=ON` to enable high-quality
stretching with libsbsms, if available, as it will be disabled by default.

Build Tenacity:

```
cmake --build build
```

Run Tenacity:

```
build/Debug/tenacity
```

Optionally, install Tenacity:

```
cmake --install build
```

## Build options

### Options Controlling The Build Process
  * **VCPKG** (ON|OFF): whether to use dependencies from vcpkg. ON by default
    for Windows and macOS; OFF by default for Linux.
  * **VCPKG_ROOT** (file path): path to vcpkg Git repository, defaults to
    using the vcpkg submodule in the Tenacity repository
  * **SCCACHE** (ON|OFF): whether to use sccache for compiler caching to
    speed up rebuilds. ON by default if sccache is installed.
  * **CCACHE** (ON|OFF): whether to use ccache for compiler caching to speed
    up rebuilds. ON by default if ccache is installed. If sccache and ccache
    are both installed, sccache will be prefered.
  * **PCH** (ON|OFF): Enables the use of precompiled headers. ON by default if
    either ccache or sccache was not found or was disabled.
  * **PERFORM_CODESIGN** (ON|OFF): Performs codesigning during the install step.
    This only works on Windows and macOS and requires the appropriate certificates
    to be installed in order for signing to work. **Note that codesigning and
    notarization might be broken as they haven't been tested**.
  * **PERFORM_NOTARIZATION** (ON|OFF): [macOS Only] Performs notarizaiton during
    the install step. This only works on macOS and if PERFORM_NOTARIZATION has
    been enabled.
  * **MANUAL_PATH** (file path): Path to the manual to package alongside DMG
    and InnoSEtup targets. If no path is specified (default), no manual is
    packaged.
  * **AVX** (ON|OFF): Enable the usage of AVX in builds instead of SSE4. If you
    have hardware made within the last decade, it should be enabled. Currently,
    it is disabled for now, but will likely get enabled in the next release.
  * **AVX2** (ON|OFF): Enable the usage of AVX2 in builds instead of SSE4 or
    AVX. Most computers made within the last decade will support AVX2, although
    this option is currently disabled by default for now.
  * **AVX512** (ON|OFF): Enable the usage of AVX512 in builds instead of SSE4
    or AVX2. This option takes precedence over -DAVX and -DAVX2. Disabled by
    default.

### Options Controlling Features

The following feature options are enabled by default if the required libraries
are found. Otherwise, they are disabled automatically. You may explicitly
disable them if you prefer or if your distribution has outdated libraries that
do not build with Tenacity.

  * **MIDI** (ON|OFF): MIDI support. Requires PortMidi and PortSMF.
  * **ID3TAG** (ON|OFF): ID3 tag support for MP3 files. Requires libid3tag.
  * **MP3_DECODING** (ON|OFF): MP3 decoding support. Requires libmad.
  * **MP2** (ON|OFF): MP2 codec support. Requires Twolame library.
  * **OGG** (ON|OFF): Ogg container format support. Requires libogg.
  * **VORBIS** (ON|OFF): Vorbis codec support. Requires libvorbis.
  * **FLAC** (ON|OFF): FLAC codec support. Requires libflac and libflac++ C++
    bindings.
  * **SBSMS** (ON|OFF): SBSMS timestretching support. Requires libsbsms.
  * **SOUNDTOUCH** (ON|OFF): SoundTouch timestretching support. Requires
    SoundTouch library.
  * **FFMPEG** (ON|OFF): Support for a wide variety of codecs with FFmpeg.
    Requires FFmpeg libraries.
  * **AUDIO_UNITS** (ON|OFF): Apple Audio Units plugin support. _macOS only._
  * **LADSPA** (ON|OFF): LADSPA plugin hosting support.
  * **LV2** (ON|OFF): LV2 plugin hosting support. Requires LV2, lilv, and suil
    libraries.
  * **NYQUIST** (ON|OFF): Nyquist plugin support. Required the libnyquist
    submodule to be initialized. **Nyquist plugins will not be installed**.
  * **VAMP** (ON|OFF): VAMP plugin hosting support. Requires VAMP host SDK.
  * **VST2** (ON|OFF): VST2 plugin hosting support. No libraries are required.
    ON by default.

### vcpkg Options

These options apply to all platforms where vcpkg is available. They are
available if you need further control over how Tenacity uses vcpkg if its usage
is required.

#### Setting a Triplet

By default, Tenacity automatically selects the appropriate triplet to use for
vcpkg. Luckily, on Windows, the default one can be used. On macOS, either
`arm64-osx-dynamic` or `x64-osx-dynamic` is used depending on your CPU. On
Linux, `x64-linux-dynamic` is used. Tenacity requires that it be built against
all dynamic libraries, and this is why this is done.

Unfortunately, this selection isn't perfect. In that case, or if you want to
use a different triplet in general, set the `VCPKG_DEFAULT_TRIPLET` environment
variable to your preferred triplet. On macOS and Linux, run this command to set
it:

```bash
export VCPKG_DEFAULT_TRIPLET="your-triplet-here"
```

For Windows Command Prompt:

```batch
set VCPKG_DEFAULT_TRIPLET="your-triplet-here"
```

For PowerShell

```powershell
$env:VCPKG_DEFAULT_TRIPLET="your-triplet-here"
```

## Building Packages
Building a package is extremely simple. Before starting, you must ensure all of
Tenacity has been built and is up to date (i.e., nothing needs a recompile).
Then, all you need to do is run the following command:

```bash
$ cpack /path/to/build/folder
```

All outputs are in the `package/` directory in your build folder. They will be
one of the following:

- An (Inno Setup) installer for Windows
- A DMG for macOS, or
- An AppImage for Linux

Along with your package comes a JSON file and various `.sha256` files. The JSON
files are simply unused artificats of the packaging process, while the
`.sha256` files contain the SHA256 hashes of the packaging artifacts. They are
automatically generated by CPack to save us a step when we build nightly and
official release binaries. You can simply delete both of those files if you
plan on only using these packages for yourself.

While the packaging process is very simple, there are some advisories, which
are listed below. It is _highly_ recommend that you read them so you are aware
of potential issues you may encounter.

### Inno Setup Installer Notes
In previous versions of Tenacity, the installer was _not_ built by CPack and
instead by its own target `innosetup`. This requires that you have previously
built Tenacity. To build the installer, you must build that target.

### AppImage Notes (Linux)
Unfortunately, the AppImage is a bit finicky right now; it might not run on all
distros, and some distros (notably Arch at the moment) may fail to build the
AppImage successfully. At this time of writing, Rocky Linux 9 (or, presumably,
any similar distro) can successfully build the AppImage.

Only x86_64 is supported at the moment. We do not plan to support x86 but are
interested in supporting aarch64. You are welcome to open a pull request to
make this happen.

If you are using vcpkg, you must set `VCPKG_LIB_PATH` to the directory in your
build folder where vcpkg copied its libraries older. For example, this could be
`/path/to/build/folder/vcpkg_installed/x64-linux-dynamic/lib`. Leaving this
variable unset will cause the script to leave out vcpkg's libraries, which can
cause issues.
